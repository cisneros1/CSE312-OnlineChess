So I made a way to change the color of the background to the color the user wants at login and added it to the database
when a user changes a coler it will change their background and persist until it is changed again


I began implementing image handling
in functions.js I added a message type detection to handle the message and send a ws message with a specific message type
Though I still have to work on the actual paths for them in the websockets function


Once these two things are completely done we just have to figure out the DM
- How I propose we do this
- when a user clicks to dm someone we send a GET request to a path containing both their names
here we can have them play and chat over websockets
- THERE should be no getChatHistory as it would be to difficult to deal with
- They will just lose their chat history on refresh unless we make another database collection containing
pairs of communications such as [(chat-user1_user2), (chat-user3_user4)] which is a list of tuples or can be a list of dictionaries
each pair which gets added to the database and when GET .starts with (challenge) then find user1 and user2 add them to the database as a pair
but then when calling GET .starts with (chat) look for the match in the list and retrieve that pairs chat history
